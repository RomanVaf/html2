									<p>Antalya (Turkish pronunciation:[anˈtalja]) is the fifth-most populous 
										city in Turkey as well as the capital of Antalya Province.
										It is seen as the "capital of tourism" in Turkey. 
										Located on Anatolia's southwest coast bordered by the Taurus Mountains, Antalya is the largest 
										Turkish city on the Mediterranean coast outside the Aegean region with over 2.6 million people in its metropolitan area.
										The city that is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon,
										which was soon conquered by the Romans. Roman rule saw Antalya thrive, 
										including the construction of several new monuments, such as Hadrian's Gate, and the proliferation of neighboring cities.
										The city has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Empire in 1207 and an expanding Ottoman Empire in 1391.
										Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years.</p>

								<div class="timeline-body">
									<p>Rosh HaNikra or Hanikra (Hebrew: ראש הנקרה, lit. "Head of the Grotto"; Arabic: رأس الناقورة, Ras an-Nakura) is a geologic formation on the border between Israel and Lebanon, located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, in the Western Galilee.
									It is a white chalk cliff face which opens up into spectacular grottos.
									The Rosh HaNikra grottoes are cavernous tunnels formed by sea action on the soft chalk rock.
									The total length of the tunnels is some 200 meters.
									They branch off in various directions with some interconnecting segments.
									A tunnel was built by the British for the Haifa-Beirut railroad line, and in 1968 a second one was dug, both connecting the grottoes with each other and allowing access (currently: only exit) along the former route of the British railroad.
									For many years though, the only access to the grottoes was from the sea and the native swimmers and divers were the only ones capable of visiting.
									The 400 meters long tunnel dug in 1968 between the grottoes and slightly above sea level allowed easier access, and soon after a cable car was built to take visitors down from the top of the cliff to the tunnels.
									With a 60-degree gradient, this cable car is advertised as the steepest in the world.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="timeline-body">
									<p>Nahal Zavitan, found near Kazrin, is a beautiful hike with streams, deep pools and an impressive waterfall at its end.
									It is one of the most scenic routes in the Golan. The hike is a long linear hike of medium difficulty.
									This means one returns on the same path on the way back or one uses 2 cars and parks a car at each entrance.
									The route starts and ends in the Upper Zavitan (חניון נחל זוויתן) if you have 1 car.
									If you have 2 cars, one can be parked at the end of the route at the Yehudia parking lot (חניון יהודייה), This parking lot is part of the Yehudia reserve and therefore is a paid parking lot.
									Start the route on the red markings from the Zavitan parking lot.
									The first 30min of the walk involves a bit of climbing up and down boulders.
									Gradually pools will start to appear, but they are shallow and not appropriate for swimming.
									Continue walking for another 30-40 minutes and you will reach the black red trail junction.
									From here you will start to encounter deep pools appropriate for swimming.
									If you continue on the red route after about 10minutes you will get to the Zavitan pool, a beautiful pool decorated by hexagonal stones.
									After about another 15minutes of walking one will see the Zavitan waterfall, a 27 meter high waterfall.
									When you get to the blue and red trail junction, follow the blue path down to the waterfall.
									Once you are finished with the waterfall retrace your steps to the blue and red juntion and continue (follow the signs) for another hour to the Yehudia parking lot.
									The walk from Zavitan to Yehudia parking lot is about 8km.</p>

									Jordan and the Golan Heights border the river to the east, while the West Bank and Israel lie to its west.
									Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river.
									The river holds major significance in Judaism and Christianity.
									According to the Bible, the Israelites crossed it into the Promised Land and Jesus of Nazareth was baptized by John the Baptist in it</p>
